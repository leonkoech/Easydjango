**easydjango is an automation software for creating django webapps with one command.**

I created easydjango to help me easily create django projects (I'm kinda lazy sometimes) and save major django development time.

Easydjango also automatically runs the server and opens the browser with selenium after it has created the webapp

## Usage

``easydjango create [project_name] [app_name] [optional:port_number]``


## Requirements

easydjango requires you to have django already installed on your system

```pip install django```

verify with

```django-admin --version```


easydjango requires the following to open a browser window once it is done creating the web app.


1. selenium 3.141.0 

- [documentation](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/api.html#selenium.webdriver.remote.webdriver.WebDriver.current_url)

- [download](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)

2. chrome version 80 

- [download](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjwpqv0BRABEiwA-TySwcmdG9S6AfkK0EmkAgCUchDrG_NLrQmbyZ5PcTMYACxK2po4Tsq5nhoCZh0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

3. chromedriver 80.0.3987.106

- [download](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)


4. python 3.7.3+ 

- [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Setup

If you are going to let easydjango open a browser, make sure chrome driver and the chrome binary are set to the right directory in the easydjango.py file

```
        options.binary_location = "/usr/bin/google-chrome"
        driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options, executable_path='/usr/local/bin/chromedriver')
```

if you do not wish to use the selenium webdriver (boo!) you can remove this line from your easydjango.py file

```def create:

        #remove this line
        openbrowser()
```

## Installation

This is the fun part. Making easydjango acessible through the terminal.
Also a disclaimer of sorts, this installation is for linux systems. Please look on how to make a python script executable for your operating system.

1. clone easydjango project to a directory of your choice and open the easydjango folder. 

    ``easydjango/easydjango``

2. run the following command in a terminal

    ``chmod +x easydjango.py``

3. edit the shebang - *the* **!/usr/bin/env python3** *at the top to match the location of your python environment. Though this shebang should work on both mac and linux systems for python 3*

4. drop the .py extension by running the following command

    ``mv easydjango.py easydjango``

5. Now add easydjango to your path. Start by creating bin directory if you don't already have it. It's in home/bin
        create bin
    ``mkdir -p ~/bin``
        or  continue if bin already exists

6. copy script to bin

    ``cp easydjango ~/bin``

7. finally add it to your path. You can either add it temporarily or permanently.
        to add it temporarily run the folowing command(so that you can test it out)
    ``export PATH=$PATH"=$HOME/bin"``
        to add it permanently 
    ``echo 'export PATH=$PATH":$HOME/bin"' >> .profile``
        refresh terminal with the following commannd OR just open a new terminal
    ``source .profile``
